# Proposed-model-for-MedAI21
The repo is created to share my proposed model that I used to participate in MedAI21 challenge. 
The paper title is "**Employing  GRU  to  combinefeature  maps  in  DeeplabV3  for  abetter  segmentation  model**"
We used GRU to project/combine the feature maps produced by ASPP layer in DeeplabV3
